# FastAPI Boilerplate with Celery, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Docker

This repository provides a robust FastAPI boilerplate that incorporates essential tools for building scalable and efficient web applications. The stack includes:

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **Celery**: A distributed task queue system that handles background processing.
- **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system.
- **RabbitMQ**: A message broker that enables communication between various parts of your application.
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment and scalability.

## Features

- **FastAPI Integration**: Leverage the power of FastAPI for building APIs quickly and efficiently.
- **Celery for Asynchronous Tasks**: Utilize Celery for handling background tasks and asynchronous processing.
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: Integrate SQLAlchemy for easy database interactions and management.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Use PostgreSQL as the relational database to store and retrieve data.
- **RabbitMQ Message Broker**: Enable communication between components using RabbitMQ for efficient message handling.
- **Docker Containerization**: Easily deploy and scale your application using Docker containers.
